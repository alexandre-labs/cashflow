# Cash Flow

This is a tiny and simple library to work with cash flow. I'm actually learning about cash flow,

## What I think a cash flow is

I understand "cash flow" as a register (or a list) of two or more transactions. Each transaction is
represented by an amount (value) and a its operation date.

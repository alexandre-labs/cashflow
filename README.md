This is a tiny and simple library to work with cash flows. I'm actually learning about cash flows,
so the whole repository is just an experiment. (no news here :])

## What is a cash flow:

(FIXME): [What I undertand as] A cash flow is a list of transactions. For this moment, I don't need
to know what the context of these transactions (e.g. product, company, etc).

### Ok...and what is a transaction:

(FIXME): A transaction is a register of an operation. This register has a value and a timestamp.
Under the hood, it also has metadata attached (e.g. uuid or something else related to the context)
